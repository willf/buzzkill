Every NY Times spelling bee solved

## Usage

```./buzzkill <letters>```

## Example

```./buzzkill "Vaehlny"```

Note that the required letter must be capitalized. The letters can be in any order. The NY Times word list isn't public, so the word list included is only an approximation, so some acceptable words will be missing, and some unacceptable words will be included. This word list contains racial slurs.
